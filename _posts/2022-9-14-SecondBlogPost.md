## 0.1 Project Blog Post

I recently finished up my first ST558 project of the semester.It was a challenging assignment but I managed to learn a lot while working on it. The purpose of this project was learning to write functions that reads in, manipulates and processes data sets that come in a particular form, as well as plotting this information. I managed to get a better understanding of the material I've learned up until this point which includes but not limited to chaining, conditional statements, creating new variables and filtering data. My understanding of functions has deepened so now I know the basic structure of functions in r and how to pass in arguments to them.  Furthermore, I managed to learn a new function, which is the substr function and how to utilize it to extract the characters you want. 

Even though I am satisfied with how my project turned out, there are some things I would do differently. The layout of my html for the project isn't too neat. I should have subdivided each of my r code chunks into sections corresponding to each step instead of including it in only one big chunk. Furthermore, for my county plot, I would output the graph so that it would plot the top or bottom 5 overall data if no state name was passed instead of a blank plot being shown.
