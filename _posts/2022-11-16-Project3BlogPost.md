## 0.1 Project Blog Post


For this project, my project member and I read in an online popularity data set. We decided to do an analysis on each data channel, which includes testing linear and ensemble methods, producing summary statistics and graph to determine the relationships between certain predictor variables and the number of shares.

I wouldn't really do anything too differently on this project. Maybe next time, I would do another transformation on the shares variable and see how that compares to the log transformation Xi and I did on the response.


For me, the hardest things was trying to automate the production of the reports, since automation was one of my weakest points for this class. I tried trouble shooting but mostly came up fruitless. After watching the lectures, I managed to gain a better understanding on the process. 


In our analysis, I obtained a better understanding on how to look at PCs and biplots/screeplots. This deepened my understanding of the concept. Also, the ensemble methods seem to perform better than the linear ones Xi and I used.
