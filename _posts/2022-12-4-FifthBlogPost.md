I've managed to learn a lot from this course! I had some knowledge of R before taking this course but I've learned more applications with R. I know to incorporate different model testing. Before, I  wasn't familiar with the concepts of supervised/unsupervised learning and knowing the techniques for each one was fascinating. 

In regards to what I want to do in relation to data science/statistics would be more visualization as that's my favorite aspect of this course. I think it's a great way to communicate your findings to anyone in the professional world.For learing new aspects/areas, I'm not too sure at the moment(it's moreso I want to learn more data analytics tools such as PowerBI or using python for data analysis.)
