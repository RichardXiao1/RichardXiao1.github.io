To determine the variables I would need for my model, there should be an increase in R squared value for each  
predictor that has been added to the model. Also, we want a decrease in our p values for each predictor added so 
any variable that would increase the p value should be eliminated from the model. Furthermore, I look for a mallows Cp value that 
that is low. My preferred method of variable selection would have to be stepwise since it has the ability to manage a large amount 
of predictor variables and is also faster compared to other model selection models. Also, the order of elimination 
of the variables or the order on how variables are added can give us valuable info about the quality of the predictor variables.
