I think R has a lot of similarities and differences to Python, which is
the other programming language I have experience with. Both have similar
syntax with each other and can load packages as well as producing output
such as graphs. However, R is used mainly for statistical analysis
whereas Python gives a more general approach to data science. The good
things that I miss about Python is the number of support libraries I
have access to such as NumPy and how Python to me is easier to grasp
than R. Like any other programming language, R requires extensive amount
of time and practice to understand. In my other classes, I had to search
up functions and help forums to broaden and develop my understanding of
R, as well as reading my notes/ watching lectures. Even today, I am
still learning and developing my knowledge about R.
