For my process of doing exploratory data analysis, I would take time in 
understanding the topic and purpose of the data set. In other words, 
do we need to use it for prediction of future trends or is it used 
for just exploratory purposes? The attributes of the data is important to look at as well, such as the number of variables and how many of 
each type of variable is present in the dataset.Missing data should be 
taken into account as well while doing EDA. Once I finish with the preliminary steps, I would construct graphs to see the shape and distribution of the data, as well as creating tables to get the basic descriptive statistics from this info. Seeing a visual representation
of the graphs can allow me to see any outliers. It's also important to see any correlation among the variables.


For me, the goal of EDA is identifying any relationships between variables,finding patterns and trends in the data, and using this information to select the right model.My methods, which I think are important, is plotting data in graphs and simple statistics. I look for any relationships between variables(one way of doing this is looking at odds ratio), and noting any kind of correlation.
