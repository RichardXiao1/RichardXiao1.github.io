## 0.1 Project Blog Post


For this project, my project members and I decided to use the food api to obtain our information for our analysis. In a nutshell, We created multiple functions to find the types of cuisines, diets and wine. There were also various attributes we wanted to examine, which includes macronutrient content, wine price and average wine rating. 

For me, it was a bit tricky getting acclimated to the food API. Before the project, my knowledge of APIs were shaky so it was hard to even get the information that we needed for the project. But I managed to figure it out with the help of my project members. In terms of programming, I had difficulty with incorporating allergies into the dataset. I think when doing a project similar to this, I probably wouldn't do anything differently. The main thing would be getting used to the API and doing similar wrapper functions to get the data I need.  


In our analysis, we noticed that for the contingency table for diet and cuisine, Japanese and Mexican cuisine have the highest amount of dishes for each diet type. But what's also interesting was the fact that they have the exact same numbers with each other for all diets. We think that this could be an error in the API data. Another surprising observation to me was how the preparation time for the cuisines doesn't seem to vary that much. I was expecting to see a skewed distribution in our bar plot.
