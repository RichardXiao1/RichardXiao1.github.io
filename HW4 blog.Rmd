## Blog Post

I think R has a lot of similarities and differences to Python, which is the other programming language I have experience with. Both have similar syntax with each other and can load packages as well as producing output such as graphs. However, R is used mainly for statistical analysis whereas Python gives a more general approach to data science. 




## R Markdown output

```{r iris, echo = FALSE}
plot(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
